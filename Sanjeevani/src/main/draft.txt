User Perspective

First User Login
What Technology do we use?
  Firebase Authentication
  Basic Thing that can be done and we obtain
  *Login and Singup using Phone Number,Googleetc
  *OAuth And token Based login
!Challenges
Integration
Not able to use JWT
Integration in Spring Security

Second Interface and Whats On display
On Front Book an Ambulanec or Call 108
Ai Digonsis at left bottom User profile On right top
Patient status id booked an  ambulance and setting and generic stuff common in all pages

Now if user wants to book an ambulance first we use default 108 in case we dont have any response within  2 minutes
we will book ourself in bookin user nned to specify location which will be detected by GPS and then we will book an ambulance
then  they need to specify type of acident or illness and they can also request for medicine if they know the name of the medicine
and other details like blood group and other details


User can get their past medical history booking etc
!Challenges
requesting for ambulance by ouselve and what if no ambulance is available


Hospital Perspective
A hospital can register itself and then they can see the request for ambulance and they can accept or reject the request
they can also see the patient details  and Vechile status such as petrol and other trival and major stuff as well
and where ambulace at their status and driver details etc

!Challenges
Integration of google maps
Tracking everything


Ambulance Perspective
A ambulance can register itself and then they can see the request for ambulance and they can accept or reject the request
they can also see the patient details


Patient Perspective
A patenit doesnt have much perspective to be honest

Admin Perspective
A Admin can see all the request ambulance and pateinta hospital






Implentation , Challenges , Fesability and Future Scope

Starting from beginning When user requests for an ambulance there can be many scenoiors  espically when he need to book manully
When they dial 108 from app when reciver on other  end is aviavle we can speed up the process and book an ambulance
by giving location and other past medical history  which will be stored in database and speed up this entire process
If no one is avaiable  call should be rediredt to AI which based on availabilty of hospital and ambulance will book an ambulance
Ai similary check i user exists in database or not and if not it will ask for details and then book an ambulance
and speed up process
If not then user need to specify location and other details and then book an ambulance

Challenges
First  what should be time period when user book an ambulance  or should call an 108 should there ba an time period at all
what if user fakes accident or illness and books an ambulance
how would you prevent misrepresentation of data like when no capacity is aviavle still booking an ambulance
what if user is from remote area and uneducated if he/she want to book an ambuance in only their native language
how would machine on other end understand that also how would an AI understande the language of user
like in case requestsing an ambulace can be very panic and user can be in hurry and can speak in their native language
Or what in situation where you dont have a better internet connection and you are not able to book an ambulance
What id user doesnt know what type of illlness he/she is suffering or they only know diesase  name in their native language
how to overcome it

Possible Solution
We can use google translate api to convert the language of user to english and then book an ambulance
we can also use google maps api to detect the location of user and then book an ambulance
we can also use google api to detect the language of user and then book an ambulance
We can train ai on different languages  for diseases and other stuff so it can bookan ambulance

Say Now  we have found a driver and illness have been reported everything is now track as of yet
#Challenge2
Now when booked an ambulance how to reach the user fastest simple way could be over distance but what if there is traffic
or what if there is a road block or what if there is a landslide or what if there is a flood or what if there is a fire
how would you reach the user in that case or road to that way doesnt exist or what if there is a accident on the way


Possible Solution
We can use google maps api to detect the fastest route to user and then book an ambulance also
modify it according to the traffic and  time  to get to that locataiona and road condition now shortest way not nessciraly be
the fastest way to reach the user Imaagone a 1km road with proper road and less traffic and a 500m road with traffic and bad road
and high traffic in maps using distanace as paramter driver may choose 500m road but in reality 1km road is faster
so we need to take care of that as well so we need to modifu algorith such that it can take care of all the paramters

#Challenge3
No how are we sure about our algorithm that it will work in all the cases and how are we sure that it will work in all the cases
it need to be tried and tested not only standalone buit also with other algorithm to show which is best say
sistance and time  we can get it  what about road condition and other stuff how would we know  to bulid our algorithm
classifcation of threts




Now when multipl request are there how would we know which one to choose and which one to reject
So we need to design a proity queue and then choose the request based on that we need to divide sercity of situation in many
levels and according to that request say someone broke their head and other is in critical situation
something related to heart attack or something we need to choose the request based on that and then book an ambulance
So we when requested for an ambulance we need to classify the request based on that push it in proity queue and then choose the request

#Challenge4
how do you know for sure that user is actually tellin the truth and not faking it
Other challenge  that i forgot like   to speed up ambulance booking procees we are using AI and and checking that
user exists in database or not  and we are also storing user data during before and after service so
what about data privacy andd secutiry of user data how would we ensure that user data is safe and secure
also what if someone what to opt out of service how would we ensure that their data is deleted from our databasw


Possible Solution
We can use firebase authentication to store user data and then delete it after service is done
we encrypt user data and then store it in database and then delete it after service is done
we use strict privacy policy and then store user data and then delete it after service is done
also we make make clear why are we storing their medical record and what for we are using



We can also get user data from other medical apps and use it  to bulid a better user profile




Implentation
We can use firebase authentication to store user login and sign up
Iam assuming firebase take care of all the security and other stuff like user is using same phone number but different user name or mail et
then user send request for ambulance in database i guess in real time with our data
post call happedns here we need to aauthenticate this infirmation here  we go throght ambulace which have
attribute their status aviavle we need to get the ambulance which is nearest to user so use our algorithm we check do i need to
set like first check within 500m then 700m or does algorithm does that for us
then in case we get ambulanlace driver need to get fatsest way possible to reach user so we use google maps api to get the fastest route
and then we need to check the road condition and other stuff so we need to modify our algorithm to take care of that as well



First Needs a Basic Impleementation Of Idea
And Idea is to book an ambulance and then reach the user as fast as possible
SO First when User fills details of Patents
user is User and it get handled by userRepository , AuthContrllor, UserService
WHere As a patenit is handles by what
When a patent is repsented reuest goes to Patent controller patent controller
    would  take patent illness and  ciondition  they have get location of patient and books an ambulce
we need to speed things up location should be tracked by GPS  and
User should get asking of situation like what is injury and servity and bloodgroup and ofcourse location
